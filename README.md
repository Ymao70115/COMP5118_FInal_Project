The project is completed based on the hard work of this team. We have learned a lot, not only from the free resources and papers we have found on the internet, but learned from each other. Effective communication significantly shortened the time of discussion within the group, enabling us to fully improve and reflect on the system we created in this project.

Both authors contributed equally to this research.
